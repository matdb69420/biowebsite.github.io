In the first line, the code defines a function called "printChessboard" that takes a single parameter (which is size).
Within the function, I initialized a variable(let) called "board" as an empty string. This variable is used later to store the representation of the chessboard.
I used an outer for loop to iterate "size" number of times. This loop is going to represent the rows of the chessboard.
Afterwards, I used an inner for loop. This time it represents the columns of the chessboard.
Within the inner for loop, for each iteration, the code will check if the sum of the current row index (i) and the current column index (j) is even. When the sum is even, it adds a space character to the "board" string. However if it is odd, it adds a hash character to that same string. This is what creates the alternating pattern of the squares on the chessboard.

After each row is processed, I had to put a newline character (\n) to the board string so that it moves to the next row.

When the nested loops were completed, I used the final "board" string to the console.log output so that it prints it.

The const size = 8 is used after to define the variable with a value of 8, which represents the size of the chessboard.
Finally, the "printChessboard" function is called with the size constant as an argument.
